# Polynomial Curve Fitting

This code shows the implementation of polynomial curve fitting and the regularization over the parameters.
In this example we are trying to fit the curve generate by the function sin(2*pi*x), where "x" is a vector of
values generated randomly under a normal distribution.

## How to run
```
$ python polynomialCurveFitting.py
```
The figures below shows the polynomial expansion for degrees 1, 4, 7, 10, 13, 16 and 19.
